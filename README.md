# Team-8

Problem Theme â€“ Katalyst NGO
Katalyst conducts annual outreach and enrollment drives to empower young women from low-income communities to pursue careers in STEM. However, its current student outreach and enrollment tracking process is heavily manual, relying on generic event links and paper-based forms. While this approach helps capture basic student interest.
Problems 
1. Track the performance of individual outreach events.
2. Monitor the complete journey of potential candidates from first interaction to final enrollment.
3. Provide real-time, accurate, and consolidated data to stakeholders<img width="5296" height="343" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd606fff-00fc-4d81-9e9f-f3e6f209240e" />
